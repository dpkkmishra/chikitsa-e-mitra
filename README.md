# चिकित्सा e-Mitra
Clinic and Hospital visits are now paperless.

Chikitsa e-Mitra will allow an individual to access their medical records, even any records are misplaced or lost. We have integrated Bhamashah API so the head of family can access and view all the uploaded medical records. In order to achieve this, we are connecting users and hospitals in one place. So the very next time whenever an individual visits another hospital for check-up, they does not need to bring their medical records.

By using this project, Government Health Dept. can also keep track on number of families have taken any vaccines on time. With the help of Bhamashah, they can view all the statistics with different locality related to Health and Medicines using the admin panel.

There are 3 sections for using this, 

one, from user-side providing Bhamashah Family Id,

two, from admin-panel and

three, from hospital or clinic, where a hospital can upload and view all previous records

This project has only 2 sections, User and Admin Panel.

Please refer the presentation and docs regarding the Chikitsa e-Mitra, available on git repository.
