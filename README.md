# चिकित्सा e-Mitra
Clinic and Hospital visits are now paperless.

Chikitsa e-Mitra is a Rajasthan's public welfare and patient history and prescription management system. It will allows a patient or an individual to access their medical records. It is an automated system which can be totally accessible through the e-Mitra Kendra/Bhamashah Kendra from Villages, Gram Panchayat, Block, Tehsil and City, hence one can use Chikitsa e-Mitra using Bhamashah Family Id and Registered Mobile number any time.

This will allow an individual to access their medical records, even any records are misplaced or lost. We have integrated Bhamashah API   so the head of family can access and view all uploaded medical records. In order to achieve this, we are connecting users and hospitals in one place. So the very next time whenever an individual visits another hospital for check-up, they does not need to bring their medical records.

There are 3 sections for using this, 

one, from user-side providing Bhamashah Family Id,

two, from admin-panel and

three, from hospital or clinic, where a hospital can upload and view all previous records

This project has only 2 sections, User and Admin Panel.

Please refer the presentation and docs regarding the Chikitsa e-Mitra, available on git repository.
