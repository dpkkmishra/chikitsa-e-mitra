# चिकित्सा e-Mitra
Clinic and Hospital visits are now paperless.

Chikitsa e-Mitra is a Rajasthan's public welfare and patient history and prescription management system. It allows a patient or an individual to access their medical records. It is an automated system which can be totally accessible through the e-Mitra Kendra/Bhamashah Kendra from Villages, Gram Panchayat, Block, Tehsil and City, hence one can use Chikitsa e-Mitra using Bhamashah Family Id and Registered Mobile number any time.

There are 3 sections for using this, 
one, from user-side providing Bhamashah Family Id
two, from admin-panel
three, from hospital or clinic, where a hospital can upload and view all previous records

This project has only 2 sections, User and Admin Panel.
